					Linking mobility and COVID-19 hospitalisations
					<div class="title-styling"></div>
				</h1>
				<p>
					Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Google has collected <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/" target="_blank">data</a> on the movement of people across different types of places, such as parks, workplaces, or transit stations. These data show how the number of people that visited a particular type of place has changed compared to a pre-pandemic baseline (January 3 &ndash; February 6, 2020). To know whether these changes in mobility are linked to the number of hospitalisations in Europe, we can calculate the correlation between them.

					Correlation analysis
					<div class="title-styling"></div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					By calculating the correlation between the change in mobility for each of the location types and the number of hospitalisations, we see that an increase in the mobility for "residential" category (i.e. people stay more at home) correlates with fewer hospitalisations. The strongest correlation was found between a decrease in the "retail and recreation" category (i.e. less shopping, fewer restaurant visits) and an increasing number of hospitalisations.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can look at this finding from two angles. The first one is that, as more and more people are hospitalised, European governments start closing movie theatres, museums, bars, and restaurants and restrict shopping, automatically leading to fewer people visiting these places. The second one is that shopping and restaurant visits might be the strongest drivers for virus transmission. The negative correlation might seem counterintuitive, but we have to take the incubation time of the virus into account, meaning that the number of hospitalisations will still be going up after people have stopped going to bars and restaurants.

					Wave after wave
					<div class="title-styling"></div>
				</h2>
				<p>
					Simply plotting the change in mobility for retail and entertainment against the number of hospitalisations does not reveal much more than the global negative correlation between them. However, by connecting the points corresponding to consecutive weeks, we can follow the evolution over time and see interesting patterns, such as the three waves that swept across Europe and the relatively quiet summer of 2020.
